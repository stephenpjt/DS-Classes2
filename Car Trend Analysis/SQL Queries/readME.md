**SQL Bootcamp: Car Trend Analysis**
This repository contains a set of SQL queries for a bootcamp project focused on analyzing trends in the used car market. The project uses a dataset of used car listings and demonstrates various SQL concepts to extract meaningful insights.

**Objective**
The goal of this project is to practice intermediate to advanced SQL skills by querying a real-world-style dataset. The analysis aims to uncover patterns related to car prices, mileage, features, and ownership.

**Dataset**
The queries in this project are designed to be run against a dataset of used car sales, which is assumed to be loaded into a SQL database.

**Getting Started**
To use this project:

Create the Table: Run the CREATE TABLE script above in your SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server).

Import Data: Load the data from the .csv file (not included in this repo) into the vehicle_inventory table. This can be done using your database's specific import command (like COPY in PostgreSQL, LOAD DATA INFILE in MySQL) or a GUI tool.

Run Queries: Open the Car Trend Queries.sql file in your preferred SQL client and run the queries to see the results.
