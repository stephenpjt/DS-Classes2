This repository contains a set of SQL queries for a bootcamp project focused on analyzing trends in the used car market. The project uses a dataset of used car listings and demonstrates various SQL concepts to extract meaningful insights.

**Objective:**

The goal of this project is to practice intermediate to advanced SQL skills by querying a real-world-style dataset. The analysis aims to uncover patterns related to car prices, mileage, features, and ownership.

**Dataset:**

The queries in this project are designed to be run against a dataset of used car sales, which is assumed to be loaded into a SQL database.
Here is a complete README.md file you can use for your GitHub repository. It's formatted in Markdown and explains the project, the data, and the SQL queries you've written.

You can copy and paste the text below directly into a new file named README.md in your repository.




**GETTING STARTED**

To use this project:

i. Create the Table: Run the CREATE TABLE script above in your SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server).

ii. Import Data: Load the data from the .csv file (not included in this repo) into the vehicle_inventory table. This can be done using your database's specific import command (like COPY in PostgreSQL, LOAD DATA INFILE in MySQL) or a GUI tool.

iii. Run Queries: Open the Car Trend Queries.sql file in your preferred SQL client and run the queries to see the results.

SQL Queries Showcase
This project demonstrates a range of SQL techniques, from basic filtering to more complex aggregations and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
